function name should be in capital
only renders one element in the index.js <> </>

agar UI mai updation karna hai unlike vanilla js (get element by id and all ) , this thing is done in react through HOOKS

import {useState, useEffect}  from 'react' to import the hook

let [counter, setcounter] = useState(15) 
here 15 is the default value of the variable counter 
setcounter(counter+1) will set the counter value to +1 where ever there is counter in the UI

virtual dom helps to compare itself with the actual DOM And changes are made to the things in the DOM which are changed (reconciliation) 

PROPS are used to make components reusable
passing the variables in props as constant values only
you can also pass the default values in props 

useCallback Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.

useEffect runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect.

We use Link ( has to )  and Navlink (has isactive and to ) of react router dom instead of a tag as a tag refreshes the whole page and react does not do that 

whatever we write in navlink -> goes to the router handler and from there we are redirected to our page

router and uske children, 
outlet in react router dom 
useparams to import user id from react router dom 

context api is used to declare the variable as globally so that we do not have to again and again pass the same variable as props 

you have to wrap everything around the context api tag so that we can use that context info inside everything that is wrapped inside the context api tag
